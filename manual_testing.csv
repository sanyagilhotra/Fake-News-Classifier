15228, Bill O’Reilly: I’ll Flee The Country If Sanders Is Elected President (VIDEO),"Fox News blowhard Bill O Reilly really doesn t want the future to give us a President Bernie Sanders. That s no surprise; after all, O Reilly is obviously as far right as Sanders is left. However, O Reilly has taken his fear of another left-winger as president to a whole other level. In fact, he says that if Sanders gets in, he ll move to Ireland.On a recent edition of the O Reilly Factor, the bloviating talking head said that things would be even worse than they are under President Obama, because Sanders would take all of Obama s policies and amp them up. He says that Sanders would  dismantle  current social programs, specifically Obamacare  in the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.  That s when he said he ll be leaving the United States if forced to live under such rule. And you know, look, I m fleeing. If Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I m fleeing. I m going to Ireland. And they already know it. I shouldn t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes. But I m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I m sorry. I m not doing it. Well, I got news for ya, Bill-O. Look at the clown car that makes up your side of the aisle. It s gonna be either Bernie or Hillary for the next eight years, if the good people of this nation have any sense at all. So, you better be packing your bags and getting your affairs in order. Go ahead, leave. One less right-wing talking head stoking fear and hate in the minds of ignorant viewers.Watch the comments below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0

25671, Georgia Republican Threatens To ‘Disappear’ Democrat Over Monuments To Slavery,"A furious Georgia Republican issued a horrifying threat to a Democrat over her push to remove Confederate statues. In an ominous social media post, State Rep. Jason Spencer warned that if former state Rep. LaDawn Jones doesn t abandon her fight against monuments to slavery, she might  go missing. In a contentious back and forth on Facebook, Spencer told Jones that people in South Georgia are people of action, not drama  and then added that people who don t understand that  will go missing in the Okefenokee. Too many necks they are red around here,  he wrote.  Don t say I didn t warn you about  em. Jones, a black woman who represented an Atlanta-based district from 2012 to 2016, did not back down from Spencer s threat of physical violence. Enjoy but know   WINTER IS COMING,  Jones wrote back.  You know it too   otherwise you wouldn t have found a need to even make this post or those hollow threats of not coming to south GA. Spencer now swears that he really wasn t threatening Jones. Of course. No, to the contrary, he was just trying to keep her safe by giving a  warning to her of how people can behave about this issue.  (Insert eye roll here.) She is from Atlanta   and the rest of Georgia sees this issue very differently,  Spencer said.  Just trying to keep her safe if she decided to come down and raise hell about the memorial in the back yards of folks who will see this as an unwelcome aggression from the left. Jones later said in an interview that she and Spencer had developed a friendship during their time representing the people of Georgia and that she wasn t worried about his online threat. If it were anybody other than Jason Spencer, then I would be alarmed. But we had a unique relationship in the Georgia Legislature,  Jones said.  If that had come from anybody else, I d take it as a serious threat. But she did say that she was very concerned  by his appalling reaction to her efforts to remove the statues of people who fought against the U.S. in their quest to continue the practice of owning people based on skin color. Because if that s representative of what people in south Georgia think, then yikes. You can read the tense exchange in its entirety here:Featured image via screenshot",0
30678,"Egypt's president backs Saudi purge, urges de-escalation with Iran","SHARM AL-SHEIKH, Egypt (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Wednesday he was against military strikes on Iran or the Tehran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, saying there was enough turmoil in the Middle East. In a meeting with a group of journalists, Sisi also pledged support for Saudi Arabia in its stand-off with Iran. Asked about the prospect of attacks on Iran and Hezbollah  - two days after Saudi Arabia had accused Lebanon of declaring war because of Hezbollah s  aggressive actions , Sisi stressed the importance of de-escalation.  I am always against war,  Sisi said, without spelling out who might be involved in military action. Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia called for sanctions against Hezbollah this week and accused Iran of supplying Yemen s Houthis with missiles used to target it.  I have said it once and I will say it again, Gulf national security is Egyptian national security. I have faith in the wise and firm leadership of Saudi Arabia,  Sisi said. Sisi said the situation in the kingdom was  reassuring and stable  following last weekend s arrests of 11 princes, former and current ministers, and a group of elite businessmen on  corruption allegations.  They face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain. Sisi stressed his backing of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states, which have showered Egypt with aid ever since the general-turned-president led the military s ouster of former President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 following mass protests. Lebanon has been thrust to the center of regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran since the Saudi-allied Lebanese politician Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister on Saturday, blaming Iran and Hezbollah in his resignation speech. Hezbollah is both a military and a political organization that is represented in the Lebanese parliament and in the Hariri-led coalition government formed last year. Its powerful guerrilla army is widely seen as stronger than the Lebanese army, and has played a major role in the war in neighboring Syria, another theater of Saudi-Iranian rivalry where Hezbollah has fought in support of the Syrian government. Sisi was elected a year after he ousted Mursi and his first four-year term ends next year. He would not be drawn on when he would announce a re-election bid, although he is widely expected to run and win. He hinted at doing so by February.  I have to present achievements over the past four years to Egyptians first, before saying whether I will run or not. I will do this over the next two months, December and January, and based on their response I will reach a position on running.  One candidate has already declared his intention to challenge Sisi. Rights lawyer Khaled Ali announced his 2018 bid on Monday in a speech criticizing Sisi s administration; accusing it of suppressing freedoms and causing deteriorating economic and security conditions. Egypt s economy has been struggling to recover since a 2011 uprising scared away tourists and investors, two main sources of foreign currency, but a three-year International Monetary Fund program is expected to help restore confidence. The IMF program is tied to harsh reforms, chief of which was the central bank s decision to float the pound currency last year, which halved its value from 8.8 to the dollar to almost 18. Sisi said on Wednesday he expected the pound to rally in the near future.  I expect that the exchange rate will strengthen in the coming period, because all the problems that created the crisis over the past few years before the float, I believe, have been solved,  he said. Tourism, a major source of hard currency, took a massive hit in 2015 when Russia suspended flights to Egypt, after Islamic State blew a plane out of the air that took off from Sharm al-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort in which Sisi was speaking on Wednesday, killing all 224 people, mostly Russians, on board. Sisi said he was not pressing the Russian government to restore flights because he understood its need to protect its citizens.  I have never, and will never, insist on the restoration of flights,  he said. He said security forces were making significant gains against militants, however. The military had captured a foreign fighter in a raid it carried out against militants responsible for a deadly attack on a police convoy in Egypt s Western Desert last month, he said. Three security sources said at the time that at least 52 police officers and conscripts were killed on Oct. 21 when their patrol came under attack, but the interior ministry rebutted the figure the next day and said only 16 policemen had been killed. A new militant group with links to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for attack last week. The foreign militant is the sole survivor of the raid and his confession would be revealed to the public soon, Sisi said. The Western Desert, which spans Egypt s more than 1,200 kilometre (745 miles) border with Libya, is a new battlefront for security forces, who have been fighting Islamic State militants in the Sinai Peninsula since 2013. Sisi did not specify the fighter s nationality but the porous border with Libya has been used to smuggle people and weapons regularly. When asked about his support for Khalifa Haftar, the eastern Libyan commander whose Libyan National Army has been fighting Islamist militant groups and other fighters in Benghazi and Derna for more than two years, Sisi said it did not mean he opposed the U.N.-backed Tripoli-based government, even though Haftar and his supporters reject it.  Our support for Haftar is in line with the constants of Egyptian policy; we support a political solution and our backing of Haftar is not at the expense of Fayez Seraj s government.  ",1

39633,SHOCKER! WAS MUSLIM TERRORIST GAY? Used Gay Dating App…”Frequent Visitor” Of “Pulse” Nightclub…Asked Former Male Classmate Out “Romantically”,"Of course, Mateen s Muslim father vehemently denies his son was gay. ISIS isn t gonna like this new little development, especially after they claimed responsibility for the actions of the  gay  terrorist A former classmate of Omar Mateen s 2006 police academy class said he believed Mateen was gay, saying Mateen once asked him out.Officials say Mateen shot and killed 49 people and injured 53 others at an Orlando nightclub early Sunday morning.The classmate said that he, Mateen and other classmates would hang out, sometimes going to gay nightclubs, after classes at the Indian River Community College police academy. He said Mateen asked him out romantically. We went to a few gay bars with him, and I was not out at the time, so I declined his offer,  the former classmate said. He asked that his name not be used.He believed Mateen was gay, but not open about it. Mateen was awkward, and for a while the classmate and the rest in the group of friends felt sorry for him. He just wanted to fit in and no one liked him,  he said.  He was always socially awkward. In Orlando, the Los Angeles Times reported that Mateen attended the Pulse nightclub possibly as many as a dozen times before the rampage. Kevin West said he had messaged Mateen back and forth over a year s time on the gay dating app Jack d but never met him until he saw Mateen crossing the street about 1 a.m. Sunday. He walked directly past me. I said,  Hey,  and he turned and said,  Hey,  and nodded his head, West said.  I could tell by the eyes. At least four regular customers of Pulse, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender nightclub where the massacre took place, told the Orlando Sentinel on Monday that they believed they had seen Mateen there before. Sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent,  said Ty Smith, who also uses the name Aries.He saw Mateen at the club at least a dozen times, he told the Sentinel.  We didn t really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times,  Smith said.  He told us he had a wife and child. The Canadian Press reported Monday that Mateen had been seen there over three years.Chris Callen recalled the eventual killer being escorted drunk from the Pulse bar on multiple occasions, including one incident where he pointed a knife at a friend. Said Callen, who performs under the name Kristina McLaughlin,  He s been going to this bar for at least three years. Mateen s father emphatically told The Post Monday that his son was not gay. If he was gay, why would he do something like this?  Seddique Mateen asked.For entire story: Palm Beach Post ",0
18390,Looming election may be nail in coffin for Japan's fiscal reform,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Even as a new party under a populist female leader scrambles the outlook for Japan s general election next month, one thing is clear: the winner will loosen a grip on the government s runaway debt as lawmakers forego higher taxes or boost spending. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to use the revenue from a planned sales-tax hike not to pay down debt but to spend more on education and other popular programmers. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, whose  Party of Hope  is challenging Abe s ruling coalition by effectively absorbing Japan s largest opposition party, wants to put off the tax hike altogether.  Japan has yet to emerge from deflation as consumption, which makes up a large portion of the economy, remains weak,  she told a briefing on Thursday, criticizing Abe for doing little to prop up household income. The debate is shifting to how much more to spend and in what areas, rather than on what is acceptable within the limits set by Japan s public debt, which at well over twice the size of its economy is the biggest among industrialized nations.  Regardless of who wins, there will be increased spending because that s how you win votes,  said Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.  Very few lawmakers call for fiscal reform,  Haji added.  That may be fine now, but there s no telling when loss of market trust in Japan s finances could trigger a spike in bond yields.  Japan s ballooning public debt has not bothered the bond market much so far, as investors trust the country can repay public debt with its huge current account surplus and abundant domestic savings. But the long-term risk is that snowballing social security spending for a fast-ageing population will strain government finances, making it more vulnerable to a sudden spike in borrowing costs that would hurt the economy. Japanese government bond (JGB) prices tumbled on Thursday, with the benchmark futures posting their biggest fall in three months, as investors braced for bigger spending. Abe came into office in 2012 vowing to eradicate two decades of economic stagnation with  Abenomics    his three policy arrows of fiscal spending, monetary stimulus and structural reforms. While the fiscal and monetary support reflated the economy, critics say Abe has made little progress on structural reforms. In announcing a snap election for Oct. 22, Abe said he will proceed with the sales tax hike in 2019 but divert more proceeds to education and child care, and less on debt payment. He acknowledged it was now  impossible  to fulfill his promise to balance the budget   excluding debt service and new bond sales   by March 2021 as planned. Finance Minister Taro Aso said Japan will delay the timing for meeting the target by several years, with a new deadline to be set by the middle of next year.  What s worrying is that the delay (in achieving the fiscal target) would make it impossible for the government to put the brakes on spiraling fiscal spending,  said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  The government may resort to bigger fiscal stimulus if a pull-back in demand after the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games pushes the economy into a downturn.  Finance ministry officials charged with drafting the state budget are relieved Abe will proceed with the tax hike, but stress the need to set a new deadline to keep spending in check.  It s a good thing that the premier has stuck with a primary balance goal, even with a delay,  a senior ministry official said.  Japan s fiscal discipline will remain intact as long as we set a new timeframe.  Koike s new party, on the other hand, calls for freezing the sales tax hike, makes no mention of balancing the budget and proposes boosting  wise spending  - without giving details.  An opposition win would mean even bigger spending and a collapse of Japan s fiscal discipline,  said a ruling party lawmaker close to Abe.  Critics say the Bank of Japan s ultra-easy policy is partly to blame for a lack of discipline in Japan s fiscal spending. Politicians so far are paying no price for being lax about spending because the BOJ pins the 10-year bond yield at zero, essentially letting the government borrow for free. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda says his bank isn t printing money to bankroll public debt. But some policymakers worry that the central bank could be forced to maintain its ultra-easy policy for longer than it wants, for fear that slowing its bond buying could trigger a spike in bond yields and push up government borrowing costs.  Once the economy slumps, there will be demands for more fiscal spending. Lawmakers may pressure the BOJ to keep its monetary spigot open,  said a former BOJ executive who retains close contact with incumbent policymakers. Rating agency S&P says Abe s decision to ditch the fiscal target timeframe won t affect Japan s sovereign debt ratings. But Kim Eng Tan, senior director of sovereign ratings at S&P in Singapore, warns against complacency.  I have no real concern right now about delaying the primary budget target,  he said.  However, it does prolong the period in which finances are at risk to a sudden increase in interest rates.  ",1
37389, WATCH: Republican Senator Lashes Out At CNN Hosts After Being Called Out For Supreme Court Hypocrisy,"Republicans are desperately trying to convince everyone that what they did to Merrick Garland was totally normal.On Sunday, Mitch McConnell pathetically defended his party s refusal to hold a confirmation hearing for President Obama s Supreme Court nominee by repeating the claim that it s Senate  tradition  to not confirm nominees during an election year. He also made the childish claim that Republicans did it because Democrats would have done it, even though Democrats have never done such a thing.What Republicans did to Merrick Garland was unprecedented and a total disgrace of the Constitution.But Orrin Hatch picked up where McConnell left off by using the same pathetic defense during an interview on CNN Monday.After being asked about what Republicans will do if Democrats block Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Hatch whined and accused Democrats of  politicizing  the confirmation process  while pretending that his own party didn t politicize it throughout 2016 when they refused to even grant Garland a hearing. They re politicizing this whole process,  Hatch said.  This is a guy who is a mainstream conservative, which they hate, they don t like that. And of course, they are still upset about my other friend, Merrick Garland. But the Republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential year. CNN host John Berman called out Hatch s hypocrisy. But they look at you and say that s a double standard,  Berman responded.  You call Judge Gorsuch one of the most qualified judges ever to be nominated. Almost everyone said the same thing about Merrick Garland, including you. Indeed, in 2010, Hatch referred to Garland as a  consensus nominee  and said there is  no question  that he would be easily confirmed to the high court if nominated. Garland even complained in support of Garland in 2016 by whining about President Obama s choice before Garland was chosen. The president told me several times he s going to name a moderate [to fill the court vacancy], but I don t believe him. [Obama] could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably won t do that because this appointment is about the election. So I m pretty sure he ll name someone the [liberal Democratic base] wants. President Obama made Hatch choke on those words by picking Garland. So there seems to be a double standard where you re saying, it was alright last year when we for political reasons halted the nomination of Merrick Garland,  Berman continued.  But it s not okay this year when Democrats try to halt the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. Hatch responded to Berman by lashing out with a desperate defense of how Republicans behaved in 2016 towards Garland. I ll just tell you straight up, that s total B.S.,  Hatch said.  I can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed. And both sides didn t agree. It was every right of [Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] and Senate Republicans to say we re not going to do this in a presidential year. And at that time, keep in mind, it looked as though Hillary was a sure winner and we would have gotten an even more liberal judge than that one. But that was a stand on principle. Not some new barbaric thing that some have tried to make it. Here s the video via YouTube:Let s make something clear. What Hatch and his fellow Republicans in the Senate did to Merrick Garland was totally unprecedented. They not only rejected Garland after previously praising him, they even refused to grant him a confirmation hearing. That has never happened. Republicans were so unbelievably partisan that Antonin Scalia s body was not even cold yet when they declared that they would refuse to confirm any nominee picked by President Obama. And that brings us yet again to the Republican claim that it s  tradition  for the Senate to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during an election year.That s complete bullshit. As it turns out, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to Republican claims, the tradition is that nominees can be and are confirmed despite whether it s an election year or not.That means Hatch is lying to cover his ass because he knows he and his fellow Republicans are complete hypocrites and now that their hypocrisy is coming back to bite them on the ass they want to play the victim.Featured image via screenshot",0
